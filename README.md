<h1>Python for Data Pipeline</h1>

This Python script provides a comprehensive data processing and EDI file generation workflow. It leverages the pandas, faker, and numpy libraries to handle data preprocessing, semantic masking, mapping operations, and more. The resulting 837 EDI file is generated based on the processed data.

## Key Functionalities

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Reads input data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Conducts data profiling, cleaning, filtering, and sorting operations.
   - Utilizes the faker library for semantic masking of MemberFirstName, ensuring data privacy.

2. **Mapping Operation:**
   - Loads a mapping file to replace MemberFirstName values with their corresponding mapped values.

3. **Numpy Operation:**
   - Uses the numpy library to add a random adjustment to the total charge amount, enhancing data variation.

4. **Aggregating and Joining:**
   - Performs data aggregation by grouping on the 'ProviderName' column and calculating the sum of charge amounts.
   - Demonstrates potential data joining with additional datasets (commented for flexibility).

5. **837 EDI File Generation:**
   - Generates an 837 EDI file based on the processed DataFrame.
   - Constructs ISA, GS, ST, NM1, N3, N4, DMG, and CLM segments, incorporating various data elements.
   - Closes each EDI transaction with SE and GE segments.

6. **Example Usage:**
   - Provides example paths for input CSV, output EDI, and mapping files.
